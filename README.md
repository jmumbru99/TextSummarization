-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a summary automatically with three types of technologies.

To work with the technologies and reproduce the results:

With BERT, you will only need to run the BERT.ipynb notebook in Google Colab, and it will work automatically.
With LexRankr and LSAfun, you will have to install the following packages:

install.packages("LSAfun")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("lexRankr")
install.packages("textmineR")
install.packages("quanteda")
install.packages("igraph")
